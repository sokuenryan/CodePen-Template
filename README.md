This is a excercise created in my time as a Bottega University student

OBJECTIVE:
Recreate a static version of the old CodePen homepage using HTML and CSS only. 
This project is aimed at getting features and styles as close to correct as possible for evaluation and critique from your DevCamp mentors. 
Upon completion please send in a request for evaluation via the Support App only, and one of the mentors will get back to you as soon as possible.
